# PASSWORD GENERATOR
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A password generator bot consuming Telegram's API (Telegraf) in order to study API consumption, using Typescript as back-end language.</p>

<p>The bot is on localhost, so it's currently offline, but the @ is @pgeneratorbot. If you want to test it out, let me know on my linkedin and I'll turn it on.</p>
<br />
<br />
<h2>Command list</h2>
<p><code>/start</code> - Starts the bot, giving you the main command.</p>
<p><code>/generate</code> - Generates a password. The default number of characters is 12, but you can customize by specifying after the command, e.g: <code>/generate 20</code>, for a 20-character randomized password. </p>
<p><code>/list</code> - Lists the latest 10 passwords that were generated by you with the command /generate.</p>
